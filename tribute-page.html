            <p id="tribute-info"> Ueli Steck was one of the forefront alpinists of his time. He brought a previously under-utilized style of training to climbing; 
               permanently changing the way professional and amatuer climbers approach objectives. His meticulous training earned him the nickname "The Swiss Machine"
                and allowed him to make exceedingly impressive speed ascents of technically difficult routes in the Alps, North America, and the Himalaya.
                Akin to any great visionary, Ueli had his fair share of criticism. Often times his climbing achievements were so far ahead of his peers, that they seemed unbelievable,
                such as his solo climb of Annapurna's South Face. Though anyone that looked into his methodology would soon realize that he was just vastly more dedicated and prepaired.  
                Ueli's climbing career and general persona remains as an insperation to all future alpinists, and people alike.
